# Alt World

Alt World is a custom, mobile-responsive website built for a client using a modern React and Next.js
stack. The project focuses on performance, SEO, and visual presentation, while remaining simple and
maintainable.

## Overview

This project was built from the ground up following an in-depth discussion with the client around
scope, features, and design direction. The goal was to deliver a fast, image-rich website that works
seamlessly across devices and provides a strong search engine presence.

Next.js was chosen for its static site generation and SEO tooling, helping to ensure optimal
performance and discoverability. TailwindCSS was used to rapidly build a responsive layout that
adapts cleanly across screen sizes, while maintaining a consistent design language.

## Key Features

- Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Static site generation for fast load times and strong SEO
- Optimised image handling using Next.js Image
- Mailing list signup with backend API integration
- Clean, modern UI tailored to the client’s brand

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**
- **Next.js**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **MongoDB**

## Backend Integration

The project makes use of Next.js API routes to handle form submissions. A simple API endpoint was
implemented to store mailing list data securely in MongoDB, keeping the backend lightweight and
tightly integrated with the frontend.

## Result

Alt World demonstrates a modern, performant, and visually polished web presence. It balances strong
technical foundations with practical client needs, showcasing end-to-end ownership from planning and
architecture through to implementation and deployment.
