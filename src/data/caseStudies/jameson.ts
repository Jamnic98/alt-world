    'In partnership with Jameson, we brought together the ALT Lagos creative community for a multidisciplinary cultural moment blending music, fashion and community. We partnered with rising Nigerian star Dilar to spotlight emerging talent through a vintage fashion exhibition and a styling masterclass led by Tio, with cultural leaders such as Santi in attendance. This initiative reinforced our mission to build bridges between fashion, creative expression, and youth culture across Africa.',
