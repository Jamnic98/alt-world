          At <span className="font-semibold text-gray-900">ALT WORLD</span>, we take the word
          platform seriously. To us, platforming means creating real, intentional spaces for
          underrepresented brands and creatives to be seen, heard, and valued. Through knowledge
          exchange, panel discussions, curated features, and global events, we spotlight BIPOC
          talent across fashion, beauty, music, and wellness — both online and in person. From
          London to Accra, we’ve championed emerging voices and culture-shifting brands by giving
          them the visibility, tools, and networks they need to thrive. This isn’t just exposure —
          it’s elevation.
